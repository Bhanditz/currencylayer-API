# currencylayer JSON API

[Currencylayer](https://currencylayer.com) provides an easy-to-integrate REST API with real-time and historical exchange rates for 169 world currencies, by default relative to USD, delivered in lightweight and highly portable JSON format and compatible with any application.

Exchange rate data is collected from several major forex data vendors in real-time, bid/ask prices are blended algorithmically, validated, and delivered hourly, every 10 minutes, or even within the 60-second market window.

Providing the most representative forex market value available ("midpoint" value) for every API request, [the currencylayer API](https://currencylayer.com) powers currency converters, mobile apps and back-office systems all around the world.

## Unique Approach

The online Forex API market is divided into two sections: Inexpensive, but unreliable open-source projects, and overpriced, but well-performing "Enterprise-class" APIs.

**Currencylayer** aims to combine the strengths of both into one **superior product** - delivering accurate, reliable and consistent currency exchange rates through a closely monitored API and making it accessible to small-scale businesses and startups - and conveniently low-priced for larger companies.
