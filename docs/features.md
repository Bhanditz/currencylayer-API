# API Features

## Historical Rates (available to all users)

The currencylayer API provides accurate *EOD (End of Day)* Exchange Rate data for every day since 1999.

Historical Rates may be accessed by simply appending the `date` parameter with a valid Date (Format: `YYYY-MM-DD`) to the API's `historical` Endpoint.

**Syntax:**

```
http://apilayer.net/api/historical
    ? access_key = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
    & date = YYYY-MM-DD      
```

**Example Query:**

```
http://apilayer.net/api/historical
    ? access_key = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
    & date = 2005-02-01     
```

Please be aware that Exchange Rate Data for certain currencies may not be available for each requested day (e.g. Bitcoin was introduced in 2009).

## Requesting Specific Currencies (available to all users)

For both Live and Historical Rates, you may request specific currencies by appending the `currencies` parameter followed by any available 3-letter Currency Codes (divided by commas) of your choice.

The `currencies` parameter is supported by each of the API's Endpoints (except for Single-Conversion, more info below), may be combined with JSONP callbacks, and has no limits in size.

**Example Query:**

```
http://apilayer.net/api/live
    ? access_key = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
    & currencies = AUD,CHF,EUR,GBP,PLN     
```

Using this query the API will return a standard response with only your specified currencies in the `rates` object:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "terms": "[...]",
  "privacy": "[...]",
  "timestamp": 1430068515,
  "base": "USD",
  "rates": {
    "AUD": 1.278384,
    "CHF": 0.953975,
    "EUR": 0.919677,
    "GBP": 0.658443,
    "PLN": 3.713873
  }
}
```

The currencies feature may be especially useful when working with Time-Frame Queries, as it allows you to reduce the API Response's file size drastically.

## Base Currency Switching (available to all paid users)

As a paid customer, you may request Exchange Rates relative to a different `base` currency than US Dollars, simply by appending the `base` parameter followed by the 3-letter Currency Code of your choice.

The `base` parameter is supported by each of the API's Endpoints (except for Single-Conversion) and may be used in combination with JSONP callbacks.

**Example Query:**

```
http://apilayer.net/api/live
    ? access_key = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
    & base = GBP  
```

**Example Response:**

Using this query the API will return the standard result set, but relative to the base currency you specified (in our example: GBP):

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "terms": "[...]",
  "privacy": "[...]",
  "timestamp": 1430068515,
  "base": "GBP",
  "rates": {
    "AED": 5.578448,
    "AFN": 87.869413,
    "ALL": 196.414724,
    "AMD": 719.087298,
    "ANG": 2.717836,
    "AOA": 165.601846,
    "ARS": 13.514458,
    "AUD": 1.941526,
    "[...]"
    }
}      
```

Please note that only currencies that are part of the respective result set can be set as `base` currency.

## Single-Conversion API (available to all paid users)

Using the `convert` Endpoint, you may request the currencylayer API to perform a Single Currency Conversion on your behalf.

Simply specify a `from` Currency Code, a `to` Currency Code, and the `amount` you would like to convert.

**Example Query:**

```
http://apilayer.net/api/convert
    ? access_key = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
    & from = USD
    & to = GBP       
    & amount = 10     
```

As long as you don't specify an additional `date` along with these properties, the latest available Exchange Rates will be used for your Conversion.

**Example response:**

A Conversion API Response contains more information than standard result sets. Your requested query is returned in the `query` object. It contains the specified `from`, `to`, and `amount` properties. Additionally, the API will return an `info` object, which indicates how up-to-date the used Exchange Rates are (`timestamp`) and at which conversion rate (`rate`) your specified amount was converted.

At the end of the response, there will be a `result` property containing your successfully converted amount.

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "terms": "[...]",
  "privacy": "[...]",
  "query": {
    "from": "USD",
    "to": "GBP",
    "amount": 10
  },
  "info": {
    "timestamp": 1430068515,
    "rate": 0.658443
  },
  "result": 6.58443
}
```

### Currency Conversion using Historical Rates

The currencylayer API also supports Single-Currency Conversions using Historical Exchange Rates. Simply append an additional `date` property with a valid Date (Format: `YYYY-MM-DD`) to your query.

**Example query:**

```
http://apilayer.net/api/convert
    ? access_key = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
    & from = USD
    & to = GBP
    & amount = 10
    & date = 2005-01-01
```

**Example response:**

Additionally to the above mentioned properties and objects, the API will return `"historical" : true` to confirm your request, and the `date` you specified (also indicated by the `timestamp` property).

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "terms": "[...]",
  "privacy": "[...]",
  "query": {
    "from": "USD",
    "to": "GBP",
    "amount": 10
  },
  "info": {
    "timestamp": 1104623999,
    "rate": 0.51961
  },
  "historical": true,
  "date": "2005-01-01",
  "result": 5.1961
}
```

Please note that Historical Currency Conversions can only be performed if Exchange Rate data for the respective currencies are available at the specified `date`.

## Time-Frame Queries (only Professional & Enterprise users)

If your Subscription Plan features the `timeframe` API Endpoint, you may request Historical Exchange Rates for a time-period of your choice. (maximum range: 365 days)

Simply specify your preferred time-frame, consisting of a `start_date` and an `end_date`, both of the format `YYYY-MM-DD`.

**Example query:**

```
http://apilayer.net/api/convert
    ? access_key = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
    & start_date = 2010-03-01
    & end_date = 2010-04-01
    & currencies = USD,GBP,EUR
```

This feature can also be used in combination with **Base Currency Switching** and **JSONP Callbacks**.

**Please note:** Since the currencylayer API allows time-frames of up to 365 days, queries containing all available currencies for each requested day may result in very large file sizes. For optimum performance and a lower server-load, it is highly recommended to use this feature combined with the `currencies` parameter, which allows you to request only specific currencies.

**Example response:**

Along with `"timeframe": true`, the `start_date`, and the `end_date`, the API Response's `rates` object will contain the specified Exchange Rates divided in "subdirectories" for each of the days within the requested time-frame.

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "terms": "[...]",
  "privacy": "[...]",
  "timeframe": true,
  "start_date": "2010-03-01",
  "end_date": "2010-04-01",
  "base": "USD",
  "rates": {
    "2010-03-01": {
      "USD": 1,
      "GBP": 0.668525,
      "EUR": 0.738541
    },
    "2010-03-02": {
      "USD": 1,
      "GBP": 0.668827,
      "EUR": 0.736145
    },
    "[...]"
  }
}    
```

### Date Correction Mechanisms

To enhance usability, automatic date-correction mechanisms have been implemented. If you request an invalid `start_date` or `end_date`, the API will automatically set it backwards to nearest available date - e.g. `2015-02-30` will be automatically corrected to `2015-02-28`. This enables you to sequentially request every month from the 1st to the 31st, disregarding the individual length of each month.

## Currency-Trend Queries (only Enterprise users)

Using the API's `trend` Endpoint, you may request the Development Trend (in decimal) of one or more currencies, relative to a **Base Currency**, within a specified time-frame.

Just like for Time-Frame Queries, you need to specify your preferred time-frame, consisting of a `start_date` and an `end_date`, both of the format `YYYY-MM-DD`.

**Example query:**

```
http://apilayer.net/api/convert
    ? access_key = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
    & start_date = 2005-01-01
    & end_date = 2010-01-01
    & currencies = AUD,EUR,MXN
```

This feature can also be used in combination with **Base Currency Switching** and **JSONP Callbacks**.

**Example response:**

To indicate that you are performing a `trend` query, the API will return `"trend": true`. Right below, also your specified `start_dateÂ´ and `end_date` will be part of the API Response.

Just like when performing a Time-Frame Query, the API Response's `rates` object will be divided in subdirectories (one for each requested currency).

The three properties contained in these subdirectories will be explained in **Code View** below:

```
start_rate     the respective currency's exchange rate at the  
               beginning of the specified period
               
end_rate       the respective currency's exchange rate at the  
               end of the specified period
               
trend          the currency's development trend in decimal, which,   
               multiplied by 100, gives its percentage change for 
               the specified time-frame
```

This is how the complete API Response will look like:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "terms": "[...]",
  "privacy": "[...]",
  "trend": true,
  "start_date": "2005-01-01",
  "end_date": "2010-01-01",
  "base": "USD",
  "rates": {
    "AUD": {
      "start_rate": 1.281236,
      "end_rate": 1.108609,
      "trend": 0.1347
    },
    "EUR": {
      "start_rate": 0.73618,
      "end_rate": 0.697253,
      "trend": 0.0529
    },
    "MXN":{
      "start_rate": 9.474097,
      "end_rate": 13.108757,
      "trend": -0.1757
    }
  }
} 
```

If the decimal value contained in the `trend` property is positive, the value of the respective currency increased over the course of the specified time-frame. (e.g. `"trend": 0.02511` would be a `+2.5% increase`). If the `trend` is negative, it decreased. (e.g. `"trend": -0.1393` would be a `-13.9% decrease`)

### "trend": 0

If the `trend` property is zero or not showing up at all (along with its entire subdirectory), it means that an Exchange Rate for the respective currency on at least one of the specified dates is "unavailable".

Please be aware that Exchange Rate Data for certain currencies may not be available for each requested day (e.g. Bitcoin was introduced in 2009).
